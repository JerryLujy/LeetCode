/**
 * <h1>486. Predict the Winner</h1>
 * Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the
 * array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not
 * be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.
 * <p>
 * Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.
 * <p>
 * Example 1: Input: [1, 5, 2], Output: False
 * Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.
 * If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
 * So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.
 * Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.
 * <p>
 * Example 2: Input: [1, 5, 233, 7], Output: True
 * Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
 * Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * 1 <= length of the array <= 20.
 * Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
 * If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.
