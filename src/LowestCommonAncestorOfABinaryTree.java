/**
 * <h1>236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree</h1>
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as
 * the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * <pre>

 * 6      _2       0       8
 *       /  \
 *      7   4
 * </pre>
 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
 * Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
