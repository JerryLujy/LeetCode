/**
 * <h1>328. Odd Even Linked List</h1>
 * Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
 * <p>
 * You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
 * <p>
 * Example: Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
 * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
